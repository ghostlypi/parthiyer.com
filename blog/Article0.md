## A breif welcome

If you have found your way here, welcome to my blog. I'm going to use this as an outlet to
ramble about technology, and the things going on in my life (within reason). If I know you
in real space, then you can check here to see what I'm up to, and you know how to get in touch.

For those of you who are discovering me on webspace, come say hi in Bluesky or on LinkedIn.
As for the exact content you can expect in the coming posts: 
1. I will share my thoughts on how it felt to vybe code this website, what I enjoyed and what caused self-inflicted hair
loss
2. I'll talk about my tech stack with multi-platform linux, what I've figured out, and how I automate my setup
3. You'll see a short post around any major CVEs that come up, especially if they are dangerous and have a large user 
base that needs their software manually patched.
4. Any requested takes (as long as they aren't too spicy)

## What's going on right now:
1. I'm finishing up my undergrad, so there is a lot of change around the corner. I'll do my best to try and be good about
writing but no promises (other than the CVEs)
2. I've just done a web renovation, so the next thing on the list is getting a solid Matrix server going. I've got a 
Raspberry Pi where I made the configurations, but that
came out of an autonomous vehicle I was developing, so it seems to have a tired and kinda broken USB port.
3. I'll be adopting a Framework 16 this December, so hopefully there will be some stuff to talk about w.r.t. that
4. RSS & JSS: I have to finish building my RSS and JSS (Json Feed) feed server designed, built and deployed. I think Java
is a good start because it's easy.
5. Revisiting Rush and PiScript: I have a shell and a scripting language that are both very incomplete and I'll write 
about those as I engineer those. This is very much a to-do, but still!
</br>
Hopefully you the reader are interested in at least one of the things I have talked about, and I'll do my best to get all
this going in a timely manner. I also realized that I need to tag posts from this blog, so hopefully that will be visible
soon™.
