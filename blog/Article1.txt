My thoughts on how it felt to vybe code my first website!
</details>

Let's begin with the core logic of this site. It's a static HTML website, with some Javascript for switching between
light and dark mode. The blog is a markdown blog, which is rendered to HTML and inserted into template 

The first thing I was surprised by was how well gemini-cli (the tool which I chose to use on this endeavour) dealt with 
HTML, and CSS. I wrote almost none of the HTML or CSS myself, and could really just see what it did and make small tweaks
to match my preferred aesthetic. The second feat was the readability of the AI outputted code overall. Even the generated
JS was not too difficult to put together, and the model was able to abstract away complex things like reading and writing
cookies, so I was able to focus on the core logic of the applications (admittedly minimal) JS.
